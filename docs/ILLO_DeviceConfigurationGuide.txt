ILLO Configuration Settings
===========================

config.json field descriptions:

name (string): Device identifier for Bluetooth and logging
  - Used for BLE advertising and device identification
  - Default: "UFO" 
  - Useful when running multiple ILLO devices for identification

college_spirit_enabled (boolean): Enable college team integration
  true = Activates fight song recognition and team color displays (default)
  false = Disables college-specific features
  
college (string): Selected college/team for spirit features
  - Default: "penn_state"
  - Available teams stored in colleges/ directory
  - Used for fight song recognition and team color schemes

college_chant_detection_enabled (boolean): Enable real-time chant detection
  true = Listens for crowd chants and responds with team colors
  false = Disables active chant listening (default for memory conservation)
  Note: Uses significant processing power when enabled

routine (integer 1-4): Default operating mode selection
  1 = AI Intelligence (adaptive AI behaviors; default)
  2 = Intergalactic Cruising (ambient sci-fi lighting with light sensing)  
  3 = Meditate (calming breathing patterns)
  4 = Dance Party (music-reactive light shows)

mode (integer 1-4): Default color theme selection
  1 = Rainbow spectrum colors (default)
  2 = Pink color variations
  3 = Blue color variations  
  4 = College team colors (when college_spirit_enabled = true)

volume (integer 0-1): Default sound setting
  0 = Silent mode (lights only; default)
  1 = Sound enabled (lights + audio tones)
  Note: Physical slide switch overrides this setting during operation

ufo_persistent_memory (boolean): Enable AI memory persistence between power cycles
  true = Saves AI personality, preferences, and learning to storage (default)
  false = Resets AI memory on each power cycle
  Note: Affects flash memory write cycles; AI still learns during active sessions

debug_bluetooth (boolean): Enable/disable Bluetooth debug logging
  true = Show BLE connection, scanning, and sync details in console
  false = Hide Bluetooth debug messages (default)
  Note: Bluetooth sync currently disabled for memory optimization

debug_audio (boolean): Enable/disable audio processing debug logging
  true = Show beat detection, music analysis, and audio energy levels
  false = Hide audio processing debug messages (default)

Hardware Controls:
- Button A: Cycle through operating modes (1-4)
- Button B: Cycle through color themes (1-4)
- Slide Switch: Sound on/off control + boot-time storage configuration
- Touch/Tap: Interact with AI system and trigger responses  
- Shake: Generate turbulence effects and energy boosts
- Light Changes: Wave hand over or approach ILLO for interaction responses

Boot-Time Switch Behavior:
- Switch LEFT + USB: Sound on, testing mode (read/write storage via USB)
- Switch RIGHT + USB: Sound off, development mode (read-only via USB) 
- Switch LEFT (no USB): Sound on, standalone operation
- Switch RIGHT (no USB): Sound off, standalone operation

Smart Environmental Features:
- Automatic brightness adjustment based on ambient light conditions
- Light-based interaction detection for non-contact user responses
- Night light mode in Intergalactic Cruising (sound off) with room dimming
- Environmental awareness through continuous light sensor monitoring
- Battery conservation through intelligent brightness scaling

Music System Features:
- Automatic tempo detection and BPM synchronization
- College fight song and chant recognition
- Real-time beat-synchronized lighting effects
- Support for 16th note precision timing
- Team color displays during collegiate music

AI System Features:
- Persistent personality development over time
- Environmental response and adaptation including light changes
- Interactive learning from user behaviors (touch, shake, light)
- Memory management with configurable persistence
- Autonomous attention-seeking behaviors

Memory Management:
- Optimized for CircuitPython's 256KB RAM limitation
- Automatic garbage collection during operation
- Configurable memory persistence to reduce flash wear
- Safe fallback modes when memory limits are reached
- Memory-efficient data structures throughout system

College Integration:
- Expandable team database in colleges/ directory
- Automatic fight song detection and response
- Team-specific color schemes and patterns
- Crowd chant pattern recognition (when enabled)
- Customizable team preferences and loyalty tracking

Performance Notes:
- AI learning occurs in RAM during active sessions
- Persistent memory saves occur at safe intervals
- Audio processing optimized for real-time performance
- Light synchronization maintains smooth 60fps target
- Bluetooth features disabled by default for memory conservation
- Light sensor monitoring adds minimal processing overhead

Environmental & Manufacturing:
- Enclosure 3D printed from recycled PETG plastic
- Made in USA with domestic components where possible
- Energy-efficient algorithms for extended battery life
- Sustainable design practices throughout development
- Open source to extend product lifecycle and reduce e-waste
