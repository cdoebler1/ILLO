## 🌟 **Revolutionary AI Intelligence**

Your levitating UFO isn't just floating - it's thinking, learning, and developing its own personality:

- **🧠 Adaptive Learning**: Learns your interaction patterns and preferences during each session
- **💚 Relationship Building**: Develops trust and bonds with you over time through physical interactions
- **🎯 Autonomous Behavior**: Seeks attention when lonely, celebrates when you interact with the UFO
- **📚 Optional Long-term Memory**: Can save AI personality across power cycles (configurable for flash safety)
- **🤖 Multiple Moods**: Curious, excited, investigating, calm - each creating unique levitating light patterns

*Watch in amazement as your floating UFO learns your habits, responds to your presence, and even tries to get your attention when you've been away too long - all while gracefully levitating!*
